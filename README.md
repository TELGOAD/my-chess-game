Overview
This project is a fully-functional chess game implemented in JavaScript. It uses HTML to define the board layout, CSS for styling and animations, and JavaScript to handle game logic and user interactions. The game initializes a standard chess board, places all pieces in their starting positions, and allows two players to take turns moving their pieces.

Features
Interactive Chess Board: The board is rendered using HTML elements and styled with CSS.
Chess Piece Movement: Supports standard chess moves including capturing opposing pieces.
Special Moves: Features like castling are implemented.
Move Highlighting: When a piece is selected, all possible moves are highlighted for the player's convenience.
Turn-based Play: A turn indicator shows whether it's White's or Black's turn.
Animations: CSS animations enhance user experience with visual effects during moves and highlights.

The chess board will load with pieces in their standard positions. Click on a piece to see its possible moves and click on a highlighted cell to move.

Project Structure
index.html:
Contains the HTML structure for the chess board and the layout of the game. It links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

style.css:
Provides styling for the chess board, cells, and animations. It includes classes for highlighting moves and various neon effects.

script.js:

How to Play
Select a Piece:
Click on a chess piece. Only pieces belonging to the current turn will show their move options.

View Move Options:
Once selected, the game highlights all valid moves (cells) for that piece.

Make a Move:
Click on one of the highlighted cells to move the piece. If the cell contains an opponent's piece, it will be captured.

Special Moves:

Castling: When conditions are met (e.g., neither the king nor the involved rook has moved), castling can be executed by selecting the king and choosing the appropriate highlighted cell.
Pawn Movement: Supports first-move two-cell advances and capturing diagonally.
Turn Indicator:
The turn indicator updates after every move, alternating between "It's Whites Turn!" and "It's Blacks Turn!".

Dependencies
jQuery:
The game utilizes jQuery (loaded from a CDN) for DOM manipulation and event handling.
